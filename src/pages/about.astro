            My name is Hampus Sand√©n and I have 10+ years experience working with digital marketing. In 2017 I co-founded the award winning agency 56K digital and it has since grown to one of the most respected digital marketing agencies in Stockholm, Sweden. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In 2023 I decided that it was time for me to take a step back as a board member of 56K digital and give myself the room to grow in a direction that suits me better. In the fall of 2023 I started to offer my services as a freelancing consultant.
            <br>
            <br>
            As a freelancer I want to focus on what got me into consultancy from the beginning, and that is working hands-on with digital marketing. I want to build further upon my strategic and technical background and continue to learn from others and share all that I have learned throughout the years.

          <div class="mb-10 text-justify">
            Over the years I have worked in many different roles but I feel most grounded in the role as a Data Analyst. I have a deep knowledge of many of the services that are included in the <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/" target="_blank" class="underline underline-offset-2 text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-400 decoration-indigo-400 dark:decoration-indigo-600">Google Marketing</a>- and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank" class="underline underline-offset-2 text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-400 decoration-indigo-400 dark:decoration-indigo-600">Google Cloud Platform</a> stack. Over these past years I have found myself leaning more and more towards Google Cloud Platform and today I focus mostly on these products and work with integrating the Google Marketing stack with Google Cloud.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have the proven ability to implement, extract, process, store, analyse and visualise data across many different tools and I care for user privacy. I believe that you can do great marketing without intruding on user privacy and have worked a lot these past years with GDPR related questions with some of Sweden's biggest brands.

            The education in Online Marketing gave me a deep understanding of the underlying strategic work within digital marketing. During these two years I got a good understanding of many different tools and strategic methods to be able to take the company's digital presence and communication all the way from strategy to conversion and optimisation.
